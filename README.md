## Udacity Log Analysis

This project contains a solution for Udacity Backend Nanodegree first assignment: Log Analysis.
The script is divided in a main method (that prints the entire report), and three auxiliary methods returning the queries results.

# Executing script

The script was meant to run in python 3, so running `python3 solution.py` in the main directory prints the report content, assuming that the database is already running locally.
